## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Step 1: Load ALL Individual Comments (ORCHESTRATED)

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **MANDATORY**: Use `/commentfetch` for comprehensive comment data instead of duplicating API calls:

```bash

### Phase 2: Step 2: Individual Comment Threading Verification (JSON-BASED)

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **MANDATORY**: Use commentfetch JSON data for threading analysis instead of duplicate API calls:

```bash

### Phase 3: Step 3: Quality Assessment & Fake Comment Detection (JSON-BASED)

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **CRITICAL**: Use commentfetch data for response quality analysis instead of duplicate API calls:

```bash
echo "=== QUALITY ASSESSMENT & FAKE COMMENT DETECTION (JSON-BASED) ==="

### Phase 4: Step 4: Final Coverage Report (COMPREHENSIVE)

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **CRITICAL**: Generate final coverage report using commentfetch comprehensive data:

```bash
echo "=================================================================="
echo "🚨 COMPREHENSIVE COMMENT COVERAGE REPORT (COMMENTFETCH-BASED)"
echo "=================================================================="

### Phase 5: Integration with Workflow

**Action Steps:**
1. Review the reference documentation below and execute the detailed steps.

### Phase 6: Actions on Failure

**Action Steps:**
If `/commentcheck` finds issues:
1. **Report specific problems** - List missing/poor responses
2. **Suggest fixes** - Indicate what needs improvement
3. **Prevent completion** - Workflow should not proceed until fixed
4. **Re-run commentreply** - Address missing/poor responses

## 📋 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# /commentcheck Command

**Usage**: `/commentcheck [PR_NUMBER] [--verify-urls]`

🚨 **CRITICAL PURPOSE**: Verify 100% comment coverage and response quality after comment reply process. Count ALL comments requiring response (everything except '[AI responder]' comments).

🚨 **CRITICAL CLARIFICATION - Bot Comments Must Be Addressed**:
- ✅ **"ALL comments" explicitly INCLUDES bot comments**: CodeRabbit, GitHub Copilot, automated reviewers
- ✅ **"ALL comments" explicitly INCLUDES human comments**: Team members, manual reviewers
- ❌ **ONLY EXCEPTION**: Comments starting with "[AI responder]" (our own AI-generated responses)
- 🚨 **MANDATORY**: Bot code review comments MUST have responses - either fixes or "NOT DONE: [reason]"
- 🚨 **ZERO SKIP TOLERANCE**: 100% reply rate means bot AND human comments must be addressed

🔒 **Security**: Uses safe jq --arg parameter passing to prevent command injection vulnerabilities and explicit variable validation.

## Universal Composition Integration

**Enhanced with /execute**: `/commentcheck` benefits from universal composition when called through `/execute`, which automatically provides intelligent optimization for large-scale comment verification while preserving systematic coverage analysis.

## 🎯 INDIVIDUAL COMMENT VERIFICATION MANDATE

**MANDATORY**: This command MUST count ALL comments requiring response:
- **Zero tolerance policy** - Every comment needs response except '[AI responder]' comments
  - 🚨 **Bot comments (CodeRabbit, GitHub Copilot, automated reviewers) = MUST respond**
  - 🚨 **Human comments = MUST respond**
  - ❌ **[AI responder] comments = Skip (our own responses)**
- **Simple counting** - Count comments NOT starting with '[AI responder]'
- **Warning system** - Clear alerts when unaddressed comments > 0
- **No complex classification** - No bot detection
- **Evidence requirement** - List any comments needing response by ID
- **Simple principle** - Address everything (human AND bot) except our own '[AI responder]' responses
- **Direct reply verification** - Every non-AI-responder comment (including bot comments) must have response

## Description

Pure markdown command (no Python executable) that systematically verifies all PR comments have been properly addressed with appropriate responses. **ORCHESTRATES /commentfetch for data source** instead of duplicating GitHub API calls. This command runs AFTER `/commentreply` to ensure nothing was missed.

## 🚨 COPILOT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### FAILURE ESCALATION (MANDATORY EXIT CODES):

- **EXIT CODE 1**: Unresponded comments detected - HALT copilot execution immediately
- **EXIT CODE 2**: GitHub API failures - HALT with diagnostic information
- **EXIT CODE 0**: Only when 100% coverage verified - ALLOW copilot to continue

### COPILOT INTEGRATION PROTOCOL:

- **PRE-PUSH GATE**: Must run before any push operations in copilot workflow
- **HARD STOP ENFORCEMENT**: Non-zero exit codes must halt copilot execution
- **NO BYPASS ALLOWED**: Cannot be skipped or ignored in copilot automation
- **COVERAGE THRESHOLD**: Exactly 0 unaddressed comments (excluding '[AI responder]') required for success

## What It Does

1. **Orchestrates /commentfetch** for comprehensive comment data (eliminates duplicate API calls)
2. **Analyzes JSON output** from commentfetch for coverage verification
3. **Cross-references** original comments with posted responses using structured data
4. **Verifies coverage** - ensures every comment has a corresponding response
5. **Quality check** - confirms responses are substantial, not generic
6. **Reports status** with detailed breakdown using commentfetch metadata

## Individual Comment Success Criteria (ZERO TOLERANCE)

🚨 **✅ PASS REQUIREMENTS**: ZERO unresponded comments with quality responses
- **ZERO unresponded comments detected** (explicit count must be 0)
- **Clear warning system shows no alerts** (unresponded count = 0)
- **Every bot comment (CodeRabbit, GitHub Copilot, automated reviewers) has a response** (bot feedback is NOT optional)
- **Every human reviewer comment has a response** (team feedback must be addressed)
- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Bot comments are NOT skippable - they need 100% reply rate like human comments
- **All responses address specific technical content** (not generic acknowledgments)
- **Appropriate ✅ DONE/❌ NOT DONE status** (clear resolution indication)
- **Professional and substantial replies** (meaningful engagement with feedback)

🚨 **❌ FAIL CONDITIONS**: ANY unresponded comments detected
- **ANY unresponded comment count > 0** (immediate failure with clear warning)
- **Warning system alerts triggered** (explicit alerts when unresponded comments found)
- **Generic/template responses** ("Thanks!" or "Will consider" are insufficient)
- **Bot comment coverage failure** (skipping any Copilot/CodeRabbit/automated reviewer feedback violates 100% reply requirement)
- **Responses don't address technical content** (must engage with specific suggestions from bots or humans)
- **Unprofessional or inadequate replies** (maintain PR review standards for all comment sources)

### 🎯 SPECIFIC FAIL TRIGGERS (UNRESPONDED COMMENT FOCUS)

- **Unresponded comment count > 0** (explicit count detection and warning)
- **Zero individual responses** (like PR #864 - complete failure with 11 unresponded)
- **Skipped bot comment detected** (any Copilot/CodeRabbit/automated reviewer comment without reply = failure)
- **Warning system triggered** (any alerts about unresponded comments)
- **Template responses only** (generic acknowledgments without substance)
- **Ignored technical suggestions** (failing to address specific code feedback from bots or humans)

### When to Run

- **After** `/commentreply` completes
- **Before** final `/pushl` in copilot workflow
- **Verify** comment coverage is complete

## Command Flow Integration

```
/commentfetch → /fixpr → /pushl → /commentreply → /commentcheck → /pushl (final)
                                                        ↓
                                               [100% coverage verified]
```

## Architectural Benefits

- **Orchestration over Duplication** - Follows CLAUDE.md principles
- **Single source of truth** - commentfetch is authoritative for comment data
- **Consistent data format** - Both commands use same JSON structure
- **Reduced maintenance** - Bug fixes in commentfetch benefit both commands
- **Clear separation** - commentfetch fetches, commentcheck verifies
- **Performance** - No duplicate API calls or processing

## Error Handling

- **commentfetch failures**: Clear error with diagnostic information
- **JSON parsing issues**: Graceful fallback with error reporting
- **Missing data files**: Explicit error messages with remediation steps
- **API access problems**: Delegated to commentfetch for handling

## Benefits

- **Quality assurance** - Ensures responses meet professional standards
- **Complete coverage** - Guarantees no comments are missed (via commentfetch)
- **Audit trail** - Provides detailed verification report
- **Process improvement** - Identifies patterns in response quality
- **User confidence** - Confirms all feedback was properly addressed
- **Architectural compliance** - Eliminates code duplication

## Example Usage

```bash

# After running /commentreply

/commentcheck 1603

# Will orchestrate commentfetch and verify:

# ✅ All comments have responses

# ✅ Responses address specific content

# ✅ Proper DONE/NOT DONE classification

# ✅ Professional and substantial replies

# 📊 Generate detailed coverage report

```

This command ensures the comment response process maintains high quality and complete coverage for professional PR management, with proper orchestration of commentfetch eliminating code duplication.
