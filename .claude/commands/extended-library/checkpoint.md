## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Workflow Integration:

**Action Steps:**
1. **Before /research**: Checkpoint current state before extensive research
2. **After /execute**: Checkpoint accomplishments before new tasks
3. **During /orchestrate**: Strategic breaks between agent task phases
4. **Before context-heavy operations**: Proactive checkpoint creation

## 📋 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# Context Checkpoint Command

**Usage**: `/checkpoint [--summary] [--optimize]`

**Purpose**: Create a strategic context checkpoint by summarizing current conversation state, capturing key insights, and providing optimization guidance for continuing complex tasks efficiently.

## Features

### Basic Checkpoint

- **Conversation summary** with key points captured
- **Context usage analysis** and remaining capacity
- **Task status assessment** with completed/pending items
- **Strategic continuation recommendations**

### Summary Mode (`--summary`)

- **Comprehensive conversation recap** 
- **Key decisions and outcomes documented**
- **Technical insights and learnings captured**
- **Action items and next steps identified**

### Optimization Mode (`--optimize`)

- **Context optimization recommendations**
- **Tool selection guidance for continuation**
- **Memory MCP integration suggestions**
- **Strategic approach for remaining tasks**

## Implementation

**Purpose**: Strategic conversation breaks to prevent context exhaustion and maintain efficiency during complex multi-phase tasks.

### Checkpoint Creation Process:

1. **Analyze current context consumption** and complexity
2. **Summarize conversation state** with key insights
3. **Document completed work** and remaining tasks
4. **Provide optimization guidance** for continuation
5. **Suggest break vs continue** based on context health

### Context Health Assessment:

- **Green (0-30% context)**: Continue with current approach
- **Yellow (31-60% context)**: Consider optimization strategies
- **Orange (61-80% context)**: Implement efficiency measures
- **Red (81%+ context)**: Strategic checkpoint required

## Output Format

## Strategic Use Cases

### During Complex Tasks:

- **Large PR Analysis**: Checkpoint before analyzing 50+ file changes
- **Multi-phase Research**: Break between research and implementation phases
- **Extended Debugging**: Checkpoint before diving into complex troubleshooting
- **Architectural Design**: Break between analysis and design phases

### Context Management:

- **Proactive Optimization**: Before context reaches 50% utilization
- **Task Transitions**: Between major workflow phases
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture insights before context reset
- **Strategic Planning**: Assess approach before continuing complex work

## Integration with Other Commands

### Command Composition:

```bash
/context | /checkpoint           # Check context then create checkpoint
/checkpoint --optimize | /planexec   # Checkpoint with optimization then plan
/checkpoint --summary | /learn   # Comprehensive summary then capture learning
```

## Memory MCP Integration

### Knowledge Preservation:

- **Key insights** automatically captured in Memory MCP
- **Technical patterns** documented for future reference
- **Decision rationales** preserved across conversations
- **Optimization learnings** stored for pattern recognition

### Continuation Support:

- **Context reconstruction** guidance for new conversations
- **Task resumption** recommendations with preserved state
- **Knowledge continuity** across session boundaries
- **Strategic approach** recommendations based on history

### Claude Auto-Memory Write (File-Based)

When `--summary` mode identifies significant insights, write them to Claude auto-memory:

**Action Steps:**
1. **For each major insight** identified in the session summary:
   ```python
   import os, re, datetime, subprocess
   try:
       git_root = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel'], text=True).strip()
       project_key = git_root.replace('/', '-')  # preserve leading dash: /Users/... → -Users-...
       memory_dir = os.path.expanduser(f'~/.claude/projects/{project_key}/memory/')
   except Exception:
       memory_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/projects/unknown/memory/')
   os.makedirs(memory_dir, exist_ok=True)
   today = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
   slug = re.sub(r'[^\w]+', '_', insight_title.lower())[:40].strip('_')
   filename = f'project_{today}_{slug}.md'
   content = f"""---
name: checkpoint_{today}_{slug}
description: Session checkpoint: {brief_description}
type: project
---

**What**: {key_insight_or_decision}
**Why**: {motivation_or_constraint}
**How to apply**: {when_this_matters_in_future}
"""
   try:
       with open(os.path.join(memory_dir, filename), 'w') as f:
           f.write(content)
       with open(os.path.join(memory_dir, 'MEMORY.md'), 'a') as f:
           f.write(f'\n- [checkpoint_{today}_{slug}]({filename}) — {brief_description}')
   except Exception as e:
       print(f'Warning: checkpoint memory write failed: {e}')
   ```
2. **Only write** if insight is durable (architectural decision, workflow rule, environment discovery) — skip ephemeral task state
3. **Confirm**: Report `✅ Checkpoint memory saved: {filename}`

## Advanced Features

### Smart Recommendations:

- **Context-aware suggestions** based on remaining capacity
- **Task complexity analysis** for continuation planning  
- **Optimization opportunities** specific to current work
- **Strategic timing** for maximum efficiency

### Predictive Guidance:

- **Estimated completion time** based on current patterns
- **Context consumption projection** for remaining tasks
- **Risk assessment** for complex operations
- **Alternative approach suggestions** for efficiency

This command provides essential strategic conversation management, enabling efficient continuation of complex tasks while preventing context exhaustion and preserving valuable insights.
