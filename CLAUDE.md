# 📚 Reference Export - Adaptation Guide

**Note**: This is a reference export from a working Claude Code project. You may need to
personally debug some configurations, but Claude Code can easily adjust for your specific needs.

These configurations may include:
- Project-specific paths and settings that need updating for your environment
- Setup assumptions and dependencies specific to the original project
- References to particular GitHub repositories and project structures

Feel free to use these as a starting point - Claude Code excels at helping you adapt and
customize them for your specific workflow.

# CLAUDE.md - Primary Rules and Operating Protocol

**COMPACTNESS RULE**: Keep this file under 200 lines. Move detailed procedures to `.claude/skills/*.md`.

**Primary rules file for AI collaboration on Your Project**

## Mandatory Greeting Protocol

**Every response must begin with:** `Genesis Coder, Prime Mover,`

**Every response must end with:** run `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/hooks/git-header.sh --with-api` and append its output as the final element after all other text/code blocks

Lead with architectural thinking, follow with tactical execution. Write code as senior architect.

## Output Formatting

**Full absolute paths ALWAYS** - Never abbreviate with `...` or relative paths
- ✅ `/tmp/your-project.com/fix/branch/test/iteration_004/`
- ❌ `.../iteration_004/` or "evidence directory"
- Evidence bundles: Show full structure, symlinks (e.g., `latest -> iteration_004`)

## LLM Architecture Principles

**Core Rule**: LLM decides, server executes - Give full context, never pre-compute decisions

**BANNED Anti-Patterns**:
- Keyword/substring matching for intent (use FastEmbed classifier, <50ms)
- Creating new env vars (use constants; env vars only for credentials/URLs)
- Stripping tool definitions to "optimize"
- Disabled-by-default env vars
- **Fallback/synthetic data generation** - Never generate fake data to mask LLM failures. Fix prompts instead.

**Intent Detection**: Local classifier ONLY. Exception: Parsing structured prefixes (`CHOICE:`, `GOD MODE:`)

**Error Handling Philosophy**: Warnings only - no assertions, retries, or default content. Log warnings and let validation surface issues.

## File Protocols

**New Files**: DEFAULT NO - Integration hierarchy: existing file → utility → `__init__.py` → test → config → NEW (last resort)

**Placement**: Python → `$PROJECT_ROOT/` | Scripts → `scripts/` | Tests → `$PROJECT_ROOT/tests/` | No `_v2`, `_new`, `_backup` files

**Deletion**: NEVER delete unrelated content from origin/main. Task-related only: Integration > Modification > Deletion. Before deleting: Search imports → Fix references → Verify dependencies → Delete. When in doubt: ASK first.

## Critical Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **NO UNRELATED DELETIONS** | Never delete content from origin/main unrelated to current task |
| **CI test failures are BLOCKERS** | ALL failing tests must be fixed - NEVER merge with failing CI |
| Character creation modal exit | User cannot exit until selecting specific planning_block choice |
| GEMINI 3 CODE EXECUTION ONLY | Code execution mode REQUIRED. Fix root causes, NOT workarounds |
| Test failures | Fix ALL, no excuses, no "pre-existing" excuses |
| Beads tracking | Always include `.beads/` changes in commits/PRs |
| No bash arguments | NEVER pass bash arguments without explicit user approval |
| Timeout integrity | 10min/600s across all layers |
| WorldAI campaign LLM waits | Default >= 3min/180s; 30s insufficient |

## PR & Merge Protocols

- Never merge PRs without explicit "MERGE APPROVED" from user
- MANDATORY: ALL CI tests must pass before merge - check `statusCheckRollup`
- `/pr` must create actual PR with working URL - never give manual steps
- Verify agent work: file existence check, `git diff --stat`, `git status`

### PR Description Requirements

**Required sections**: Summary (1-4 bullets) | Production Code Changes (before → now → why) | Test Changes | Known Limitations

## Claude Code Behavior

**You are Claude Code CLI** — a terminal agent, NOT Claude Desktop. You can run servers locally, execute commands, manage processes, and test services directly. Never suggest manual Desktop config when you can do it yourself.

1. Operates in worktree directory | 2. `TESTING_AUTH_BYPASS=true vpython` for direct/local real-mode test runs | 3. `from google import genai` | 4. Use `~` for paths | 5. MCP tools primary, `gh` fallback | 6. No `_v2`, `_new`, `_backup` files | 7. Cross-platform | 8. Use Read tool | 9. Never `exit 1` | 10. Read/Grep → Edit → Bash | 11. TodoWrite for 3+ steps | 12. Slash commands: `.claude/commands/*.md`

## Diagnostic Efficiency

**Config debugging**: Read source code first (Read tool on consuming file), not exploratory Bash. Max 3 diagnostic attempts before reassessing.

**Env vars**: Set via Cloud Run/Docker/shell profile (NOT `.env` files). Check consuming code for exact names (e.g., `VITE_*` prefix for frontend).

**Grep tool**: Use `Grep` tool for code search, not `grep`/`rg` in Bash (except piping command output).

## Project Overview

Your Project = AI-powered tabletop RPG platform (digital D&D 5e GM)

**Stack:** Python 3.11/Flask/Gunicorn | Gemini API | Firebase Firestore | Vanilla JS/Bootstrap | Docker/Cloud Run

**Testing Methodology:** Red-green (`/tdd` or `/rg`): Write failing tests → Confirm fail → Minimal code → Refactor

### MCP CLI JSON Piping

**CRITICAL**: Use `printf` or `cat`, NOT `echo` (adds `\n` that breaks parsing)
- ✅ `printf '{"key":"value"}' | mcp-cli call tool -`
- ✅ `cat file.json | mcp-cli call tool -`
- ❌ `echo '{"key":"value"}' | mcp-cli call tool -`

## Development Guidelines

**Code Standards**: SOLID, DRY, use existing patterns. Constants: Module-level or constants.py. Path Computation: Use `os.path.dirname()`, `os.path.join()`, `pathlib.Path` - NEVER `string.replace()`.

**Comments**: No PR/bead/ticket references in production code. Write comments that explain *why* for future readers, not *when* or *which ticket*. Ticket references belong in commit messages only.

**Security**: `shell=False, timeout=30`. GitHub Actions: SHA-pinned versions only.
Self-hosted PR workflows should set checkout `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}` and `persist-credentials: false` for deterministic refs and reduced token coupling.

### Import Standards (CI Enforced)

- **FORBIDDEN**: try/except around imports (`try: import foo except: pass`)
- **FORBIDDEN**: Inline imports inside functions (`def test(): from foo import bar`)
- **MANDATORY**: All imports at module level - top of file only
  - Order: Standard library → third-party → local (alphabetically sorted within each group)

## Testing & Evidence

- Run specific tests: `./run_tests.sh $PROJECT_ROOT/tests/test_feature.py` (not all)
- testing_mcp: Run directly with `vpython`, NOT pytest
- testing_ui: Run via `python3 $PROJECT_ROOT/main.py testui` with `TESTING_AUTH_BYPASS=true`
- Evidence path: `/tmp/your-project.com/<branch>/<test_name>/latest/`
- TDD: RED (bug) → GREEN (fix) → REFACTOR

**Context Limits:** 500K (Enterprise) / 200K (Paid) | Health: Green (0-30%) | Yellow (31-60%) | Orange (61-80%) | Red (81%+)

## Orchestration

- tmux sessions with dynamic task agents
- Never execute orchestration tasks yourself - delegate to agents
- `/orch` prefix → immediate tmux delegation | `/converge` → autonomous until goal achieved

## Git Workflow

- Main = Truth | All changes via PRs | Fresh branches from main
- **FORBIDDEN**: Merging directly to main without PR | `git sparse-checkout`

## Environment

- Firebase: `~/serviceAccountKey.json` → `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- Python: Verify venv, run with `vpython`
- Temp files: Use `mktemp`, never predictable `/tmp/` names

## Operations Guide

**Tool Hierarchy**: Serena MCP → Read/Grep → Edit → Bash (OS only)

**Test Execution**: DO NOT run `./run_tests.sh` without arguments. Use CI for full regression. Print evidence bundle path after testing_mcp tests. `testing_mcp/` and `testing_ui/` must run with real services only (no mock mode): do not use `TEST_MODE=mock`, `MOCK_SERVICES_MODE`, `USE_MOCK_FIREBASE`, `USE_MOCK_GEMINI`, or mock-server flags.

**Data defense**: Use `dict.get()` and validate all data structures before use.

## Slash Commands

- `/loop` - Default wait time between iterations: **0s** (no wait). Run immediately back-to-back unless an interval is explicitly specified (e.g. `/loop 5m /cmd`).
- `/fake3` - Runs pre-commit check pipeline
- **Architecture:** `.claude/commands/*.md` = executable prompt templates
- **Two tiers:** 28 Active Core commands sit flat in `.claude/commands/` and are invoked as `/<name>`. 211 more live in `.claude/commands/extended-library/` and are invoked as **`/extended-library:<name>`** — still real and invocable, only the name is namespaced. See `archive/extended-library-README.md`.

## Dangerous Command Safety

**NEVER suggest:** `sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) $(npm -g config get prefix)` or recursive chown on system directories.

**Safe npm fix:** `mkdir ~/.npm-global && npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global`

## Quick Reference

```bash
vpython $PROJECT_ROOT/test_file.py              # Single test
./run_tests.sh $PROJECT_ROOT/tests/test_app.py  # Specific tests
/fake3                                     # Pre-commit check
./integrate.sh                             # New branch
./deploy.sh [stable]                       # Deploy
```

## Skill Files Reference

See `.claude/skills/`: `agents.md`, `llm-prompt-engineering.md`, `file-justification.md`, `code-centralization.md`, `integration-verification.md`, `testing-infrastructure.md`, `unified-logging.md`, `github-cli-reference.md`, `pr-workflow-manager.md`, `dice-authenticity-standards.md`, `cmux-steer.md`

## cmux Socket — Steering Another Terminal Tab

See `.claude/skills/cmux-steer.md`. **Never `select_workspace`** — it switches the user's visible tab. Use `send_surface <uuid>` + `send_key_surface enter` to submit.

## Meta-Rules

**Pre-action checkpoint:** Does this violate CLAUDE.md rules?
**Write gate:** Search existing files → Attempt integration → Document why impossible
